RITA – Robô Inteligente de Triagem Automatizada [Smart Robot for Automated Triage] is a smart triage agent based on the Manchester Triage System that is able to take natural language input (text or voice) and define the gravity of the symptoms of a patient.</br></br>
This project was developed in the context of Google Cloud Day Lisbon Hackathon: Leveraging AI for Portugal. Six teams participated, and a different challenge was given to each team. Our team was tasked with creating a smart triage agent using Google Cloud products.</br>

# RITA: Robô Inteligente de Triagem Automatizada

## Description
**RITA** is a smart automated triage agent designed to streamline and improve the triage process in healthcare settings. This project was developed during a hackathon to address the pressing issue of long wait times and overcrowding in emergency services. By combining AI with clinical expertise, RITA provides an efficient triage process that reduces the workload of healthcare professionals and ensures that patients receive faster, more accurate care.

## Features
- **Natural Language Input**: Supports both text and speech for seamless interaction.
- **Multilingual Support**: Eliminates language barriers by offering multiple languages.
- **Real-Time Triage**: Helps patients triage themselves before arriving at the emergency department, reducing non-emergent visits.
- **Integration with Hospital Systems**: Connects with electronic health records (EHR) and updates the patient’s status in the hospital system.
- **AI-Driven Triage**: Leverages the Manchester Triage System to classify patients into different urgency levels, ensuring appropriate care.
- **Cloud-Based**: Uses Google infrastructure for scalability, security, and updates.

### Triage Categories (Manchester Triage System):
- **Not Urgent**: Minor symptoms such as low-grade fever or mild pain lasting less than seven days.
- **Not Very Urgent**: Subfebrile conditions, vomiting, or mild pain.
- **Urgent**: Conditions such as minor bleeding, persistent vomiting, or high fever.
- **Very Urgent**: Severe symptoms including uncontrolled major bleeding, very high fever, or severe pain.
- **Emergent**: Life-threatening conditions such as airway compromise, shock, or ongoing seizures.

## Benefits & Impact
### Social:
- **No Call Queue**: Unlike traditional emergency services or hotlines, RITA eliminates the need for waiting in call queues.
- **Shorter On-Site Wait Times**: By triaging before arrival, patients are seen faster.
- **Relieves Healthcare Staff**: Allows professionals to focus on urgent cases by reducing the non-emergent patient influx.
  
### Technical:
- **Managed Infrastructure**: Google ensures the system’s security, scalability, and regular updates.
- **Interoperability**: RITA integrates with other virtual and human agents, as well as hospital EHR systems.
- **Continuous Improvement**: Machine learning continuously enhances the accuracy of the triage process.

## Next Steps
1. **Development**: Refine the triage dialogue flow in collaboration with medical professionals and ethicists.
2. **Data Collection**: Improve access to quality data and validate user inputs.
3. **Integration**: Seamlessly integrate patient medical history and status updates into hospital systems.
4. **Launch**: Conform to accessibility guidelines and ensure a smooth launch.

## Future Features
- **Monitor Physiological Factors**: Track real-time health data.
- **Observe Symptoms**: Allow the system to monitor symptom progression.
- **Service Suggestions**: Recommend nearby services based on distance and wait time.
