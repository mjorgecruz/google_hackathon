RITA – Robô Inteligente de Triagem Automatizada [Smart Robot for Automated Triage] is a smart triage agent based on the Manchester Triage System that is able to take natural language input (text or voice) and define the gravity of the symptoms of a patient.</br></br>
This project was developed in the context of Google Cloud Day Lisbon Hackathon: Leveraging AI for Portugal. Six teams participated, and a different challenge was given to each team. Our team was tasked with creating a smart triage agent using Google Cloud products.</br>
